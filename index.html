  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Linda K. Singagerda (aka likas).<br><br>
    I'm a pharmacist with a master's degree in Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology from ITB. I'm passionate about combining life sciences, data, and engineering to tackle real-world health challenges. Throughout my experiences, I've contributed to enhancing medical data quality at an Indonesian health-tech startup, provided essential pharmacy services to my community, and taught pharmacology and chemical engineering, mentoring aspiring scientific professionals.<br><br>
    My current interests include systems biology, PK/PD modeling, computational drug design, network pharmacology, and protein structure prediction—areas I believe are crucial for advancing drug discovery and life sciences. I'm dedicated to creating solutions that make science accessible, practical, and impactful.<br><br>
    I'm actively seeking collaborations on innovative projects related to health technology, educational platforms, and cutting-edge research. Let's connect and build something meaningful together.
