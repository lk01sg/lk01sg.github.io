## About

Hi, I’m Linda K. Singagerda (Linda K. Sg.).

<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover;">

I am an independent researcher working at the intersection of life sciences, data, and systems thinking, with a focus on how biological complexity can be translated into sound scientific and strategic judgment.

I hold a master’s degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). My thesis in immunology shaped a systems-level perspective on biological networks, genetic variation, and mechanistic modeling. This approach continues to inform my work across systems immunology, systems biology, PK/PD modeling, network pharmacology, and computational drug design, particularly in contexts where reductionist methods fall short.

My professional experience spans applied research and practice. I have contributed to medical data quality improvement in a health technology startup, provided pharmacy services in a community setting, and taught pharmacology-related courses within interdisciplinary contexts, including chemical engineering programs. Across these roles, my focus has been less on execution at scale and more on understanding how assumptions, models, and data quality influence downstream scientific and clinical decisions.

Alongside formal roles, I develop independent research artifacts such as essays, research memos, and project-based analyses. These are aimed at synthesizing complex scientific developments into coherent frameworks. My work emphasizes careful interpretation over rapid commentary, with particular attention to uncertainty, model limitations, and the epistemic implications of emerging tools such as AI in biomedical research.

I am especially interested in long-horizon research questions and collaborative environments that value biological realism, conceptual clarity, and sustained inquiry. I welcome thoughtful exchange with researchers and organizations working on problems in systems biology, computational biology, and science-driven decision support.

## 📚 On Writing

I run SyntesaMateria and UPPETI, two independent digital media platforms. SyntesaMateria focuses on science and technology, publishing curated content, in-depth articles, and educational resources for students, researchers, and a broader audience. UPPETI serves as a more personal and creative outlet, where I explore philosophy, art, and reflective writing. Together, they represent complementary sides of my writing and creative practice. More details about these platforms can be found [here](https://lk01sg.github.io/media.html).

Digital resources, guides, and creative projects are also available on [my Gumroad page](https://lk01sg.gumroad.com/), offering content that extends and complements the work published on both platforms.
