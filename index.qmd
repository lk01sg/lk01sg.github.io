## About

Hi, I’m Linda K. Singagerda (Linda K. Sg.).

<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" style="width: 150px; height: 150px; border-radius: 50%; object-fit: cover;">

With a background in pharmacy and a master’s degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology from ITB, my work has always revolved around bridging life sciences, data, and engineering to address real-world health challenges. My master’s thesis focused on immunology, a discipline that now anchors my systems-level perspective and informs the way I approach biological networks, genetic variation, and mechanistic modeling. I’ve contributed to improving medical data quality at an Indonesian health-tech startup, provided pharmacy services to my local community, and taught pharmacology and chemical engineering, mentoring aspiring scientific professionals throughout.

My current interests span systems immunology, systems biology, PK/PD modeling, computational drug design, network pharmacology, and protein structure prediction—fields I consider pivotal for advancing drug discovery and the life sciences. The goal is to translate complex knowledge into solutions that are accessible, practical, and impactful.

Alongside my scientific work, I'm also an Independent Creator & Digital Strategist. I design and manage digital ecosystems where ideas can move across platforms through writing, media, and digital products. This work connects research, storytelling, and community building.

Collaboration excites me, especially on projects at the intersection of health technology, educational platforms, and cutting-edge research. If you’re working on something in these areas, I’d be glad to connect.

## 📚 On Writing

I run SyntesaMateria and UPPETI, two independent digital media platforms. SyntesaMateria focuses on science and technology, publishing curated content, in-depth articles, and educational resources for students, researchers, and a broader audience. UPPETI serves as a more personal and creative outlet, where I explore philosophy, art, and reflective writing. Together, they represent complementary sides of my writing and creative practice. More details about these platforms can be found [here](https://lk01sg.github.io/media.html).

Digital resources, guides, and creative projects are also available on [my Gumroad page](https://lk01sg.gumroad.com/), offering content that extends and complements the work published on both platforms.
