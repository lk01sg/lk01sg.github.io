## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Linda K. Singagerda (aka likas).

I'm a pharmacist with a master's degree in Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology from ITB. I'm passionate about combining life sciences, data, and engineering to tackle real-world health challenges. Throughout my experiences, I've contributed to enhancing medical data quality at an Indonesian health-tech startup, provided essential pharmacy services to my community, and taught pharmacology and chemical engineering, mentoring aspiring scientific professionals.

My current interests include systems biology, PK/PD modeling, computational drug design, network pharmacology, and protein structure predictionâ€”areas I believe are crucial for advancing drug discovery and life sciences. I'm dedicated to creating solutions that make science accessible, practical, and impactful.

I'm actively seeking collaborations on innovative projects related to health technology, educational platforms, and cutting-edge research. Let's connect and build something meaningful together.

### ðŸ“š Publications & Platforms

I also run SyntesaMateria and UPPETI, two independent digital media platforms. SyntesaMateria focuses on science and technology, publishing curated content, exclusive articles, and educational materials aimed at making science more accessible and impactful. UPPETI, on the other hand, is a more personal and creative outlet where I explore philosophy, art, and reflective writing. Together, they represent complementary sides of my publishing and creative work. More details about these platforms can be found [here](https://lk01sg.github.io/media.html).
