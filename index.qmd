## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Linda K. Singagerda (aka likas).

I'm a pharmacist with a master's degree in Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology from ITB. I'm passionate about combining life sciences, data, and engineering to tackle real-world health challenges. Throughout my experiences, I've contributed to enhancing medical data quality at an Indonesian health-tech startup, provided essential pharmacy services to my community, and taught pharmacology and chemical engineering, mentoring aspiring scientific professionals.

My current interests include systems biology, PK/PD modeling, computational drug design, network pharmacology, and protein structure predictionâ€”areas I believe are crucial for advancing drug discovery and life sciences. I'm dedicated to creating solutions that make science accessible, practical, and impactful.

I'm actively seeking collaborations on innovative projects related to health technology, educational platforms, and cutting-edge research. Let's connect and build something meaningful together.

### ðŸ“š Publications & Platforms

I also run SyntesaMateria and UPPETI, two independent digital media platforms where I publish curated scientific content, exclusive articles, and educational materials. These platforms are part of my work in making science accessible and impactful for a wider audience. Together, they serve as my main digital outlets for publishing and educational activities. More details about these platforms can be found [here](https://lk01sg.github.io/media.html).
