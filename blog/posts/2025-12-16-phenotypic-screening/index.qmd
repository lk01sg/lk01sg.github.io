**Context:** This essay emerged from ongoing reading and synthesis around phenotypic screening, polypharmacology, and systems-level failure modes in drug discovery. The initial trigger was revisiting historical drug examples alongside recent critiques of screening paradigms.

**Process Notes:**

- Compared classical phenotypic discoveries (aspirin, metformin, sirolimus) with contemporary target-first workflows.
- Integrated perspectives from systems biology, cancer resistance literature, and network pharmacology.
- Identified recurring patterns where translational failure reflects model mismatch rather than technical insufficiency.

**Open Questions:**

- How can network-level readouts be standardized without collapsing back into reductionism?
- What experimental designs best support causal inference in phenotypic–omics integration?
- Where should industry draw the line between exploratory interrogation and pipeline efficiency?

**Next Steps:**

- Explore concrete case studies combining phenotypic screens with single-cell omics.
- Examine decision criteria used internally by industry teams when choosing discovery paradigms.

_This entry documents the reasoning process behind a longer conceptual essay, rather than presenting a finalized position._
