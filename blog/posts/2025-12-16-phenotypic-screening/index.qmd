**Context:** This entry emerged from ongoing reading and synthesis around phenotypic screening, polypharmacology, and system-level failure modes in drug discovery. The immediate trigger was revisiting historical drug examples alongside recent critiques of contemporary screening paradigms, particularly concerns that many failures reflect model mismatch rather than purely technical shortcomings (Vincent & Gianni, 2025; Lowe, 2025).

**Process Notes:**

- Compared classical phenotypic discoveries (e.g., aspirin, metformin, sirolimus) with contemporary target-first workflows
- Integrated perspectives from systems biology, cancer resistance literature, and network pharmacology.
- Noted recurring patterns where translational failure appears rooted in abstraction choices and assay framing, rather than insufficient molecular resolution alone.

**Open Questions:**

- How can network-level or phenotypic readouts be standardized without collapsing back into reductionist proxies?
- What experimental designs best support causal inference when integrating phenotypic screens with multi-omics data?
- Where should industry draw the boundary between exploratory system interrogation and pipeline efficiency pressures?

**Next Steps:**

- Explore concrete case studies combining phenotypic screening with single-cell or spatial omics.
- Examine internal decision criteria used by industry teams when selecting between target-first and phenotype-first discovery paradigms.

_This entry documents an evolving reasoning process rather than a finalized position, serving as groundwork for potential future project development._
