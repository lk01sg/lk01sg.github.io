## This Week's Focus

Started building the analysis pipeline for immune cell network analysis...

## Methods Implemented

- Louvain clustering for community detection
- NetworkX for graph construction
- Scanpy preprocessing workflow

## Code
```python
import scanpy as sc
import networkx as nx

# Pipeline setup
...
```

## Challenges

Memory issues with large adjacency matrices → switched to sparse representation.

## Next Steps

- Validate clustering on test dataset
- Implement visualization
- Write up methods section

**Tags:** Working on immune network topology project, implementing graph analysis methods, debugging memory issues.
