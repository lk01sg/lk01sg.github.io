**Status:** Completed

**Context:**  
This entry documents the design and finalization of a modular research folder structure intended for projects that evolve over time, rather than projects optimized solely to terminate in a single paper. The motivation was to reduce long-term cognitive overhead and improve traceability across heterogeneous research activities.

The guiding principle is deliberately simple:  
**separate thinking, data, code, and evidence early and explicitly.**

## Structure Overview

The system is organized into three tiers, each mapped to a realistic research workload rather than an abstract ideal.

### Basic  
For literature-driven work and small academic or exploratory projects.

### Standard  
For master-level research and publication-oriented analysis.

### Advanced  
For doctoral and multi-year research with experiment tracking, versioning, and reproducibility requirements.

## Design Rationale

The emphasis is not on folder count, but on **decision clarity**.

- Raw data remains immutable  
- Manuscripts are modular rather than monolithic  
- Code is reproducible rather than exploratory residue  
- Experiments leave a traceable and auditable record  

A well-designed structure is not administrative overhead.  
It functions as **cognitive infrastructure**.

## Outcome

This setup reduces friction when switching between projects, revisiting old analyses, preparing manuscripts or proposals, and scaling collaboration or solo work.

No specific tooling is enforced.  
LaTeX, JabRef, Git, Python, and R integrate naturally, but none are mandatory.

**Net effect:** less time managing artifacts, more time allocated to actual research.

## Next Steps

Use this structure as the backbone for long-horizon computational biology projects, particularly those involving iterative modeling, multi-modal data, and evolving hypotheses.
