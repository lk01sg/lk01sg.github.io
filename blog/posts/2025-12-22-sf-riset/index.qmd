**Status:** completed

I finalized the design and documentation of a modular research folder structure intended for projects that grow over time, not just projects that end with a paper.

The guiding principle is straightforward:  
separate thinking, data, code, and evidence early and deliberately.

## Structure overview

The system is organized into three tiers, each mapped to a realistic research workload.

### Basic

For literature-driven work and small academic projects.

### Standard

For master-level research and publication-oriented analysis.

### Advanced

For doctoral and multi-year research with experiment tracking and reproducibility requirements.

## Design rationale

The emphasis is not on folder count, but on decision clarity.

- Raw data remains immutable  
- Manuscripts are modular rather than monolithic  
- Code is reproducible, not exploratory residue  
- Experiments leave a traceable record

A well-designed structure is not administrative overhead.  
It is cognitive infrastructure.

## Outcome

This setup reduces friction when switching between projects, revisiting old analyses, preparing manuscripts or proposals, and scaling collaboration or solo work.

No tooling is enforced.  
LaTeX, JabRef, Git, Python, and R integrate naturally, but nothing is mandatory.

Outcome: less time managing artifacts, more time spent on actual research.

## Next step

Using this structure as the backbone for long-horizon computational biology projects.

## Resource

A documented template version of this folder structure is available separately for those who want a ready-to-use setup.
