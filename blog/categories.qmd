## Research Process

Tags for documenting the research workflow and progress.

**`progress`**  
Updates, project milestones, and overall research progress. Use this for regular check-ins and status reports.

**`project`**  
Project-specific work and documentation. Use when focusing on a particular research project or initiative.


**`methods`**  
Method implementations, technique explanations, and procedural documentation. Use when describing HOW you do something.

**`debugging`**  
Problem-solving stories, error resolution, and troubleshooting documentation. Use when documenting challenges and their solutions.

## Knowledge Building

Tags for learning, synthesis, and theoretical exploration.

**`literature`**  
Paper summaries, literature reviews, and reading notes. Use when engaging with published research.

**`learning`**  
New concepts, tutorials, and skill development. Use when documenting learning process or creating educational content.

**`theory`**  
Theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, and foundational concepts. Use for deeper conceptual explorations.

## Technical

Tags for computational and technical content.

**`code`**  
Code examples, scripts, and programming solutions. Use when sharing executable code or implementation details.

**`data-analysis`**  
Data analysis workflows, statistical methods, and analytical approaches. Use for analysis-focused content.

**`tools`**  
Software reviews, package tutorials, and tool comparisons. Use when discussing research tools and infrastructure.
