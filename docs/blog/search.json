    "text": "Status: Completed\nContext:\nThis entry documents the design and finalization of a modular research folder structure intended for projects that evolve over time, rather than projects optimized solely to terminate in a single paper. The motivation was to reduce long-term cognitive overhead and improve traceability across heterogeneous research activities.\nThe guiding principle is deliberately simple:\nseparate thinking, data, code, and evidence early and explicitly."

    "text": "Context: This entry emerged from ongoing reading and synthesis around phenotypic screening, polypharmacology, and system-level failure modes in drug discovery. The immediate trigger was revisiting historical drug examples alongside recent critiques of contemporary screening paradigms, particularly concerns that many failures reflect model mismatch rather than purely technical shortcomings (Vincent & Gianni, 2025; Lowe, 2025).\nProcess Notes:\n\nCompared classical phenotypic discoveries (e.g., aspirin, metformin, sirolimus) with contemporary target-first workflows\nIntegrated perspectives from systems biology, cancer resistance literature, and network pharmacology.\nNoted recurring patterns where translational failure appears rooted in abstraction choices and assay framing, rather than insufficient molecular resolution alone.\n\nOpen Questions:\n\nHow can network-level or phenotypic readouts be standardized without collapsing back into reductionist proxies?\nWhat experimental designs best support causal inference when integrating phenotypic screens with multi-omics data?\nWhere should industry draw the boundary between exploratory system interrogation and pipeline efficiency pressures?\n\nNext Steps:\n\nExplore concrete case studies combining phenotypic screening with single-cell or spatial omics.\nExamine internal decision criteria used by industry teams when selecting between target-first and phenotype-first discovery paradigms.\n\nThis entry documents an evolving reasoning process rather than a finalized position, serving as groundwork for potential future project development.\nRelated Essay:\nPhenotypic Screening as System Interrogation\n\n\nReferences / Reading Trail\n\nVincent, F., & Gianni, D.
