    "text": "Design rationale\nThe emphasis is not on folder count, but on decision clarity.\n\nRaw data remains immutable\n\nManuscripts are modular rather than monolithic\n\nCode is reproducible, not exploratory residue\n\nExperiments leave a traceable record\n\nA well-designed structure is not administrative overhead.\nIt is cognitive infrastructure."

The initial trigger was revisiting historical drug examples alongside recent critiques of screening paradigms.\nProcess Notes:\n\nCompared classical phenotypic discoveries (aspirin, metformin, sirolimus) with contemporary target-first workflows.\nIntegrated perspectives from systems biology, cancer resistance literature, and network pharmacology.\nIdentified recurring patterns where translational failure reflects model mismatch rather than technical insufficiency.\n\nOpen Questions:\n\nHow can network-level readouts be standardized without collapsing back into reductionism?\nWhat experimental designs best support causal inference in phenotypic–omics integration?\nWhere should industry draw the line between exploratory interrogation and pipeline efficiency?\n\nNext Steps:\n\nExplore concrete case studies combining phenotypic screens with single-cell omics.\nExamine decision criteria used internally by industry teams when choosing discovery paradigms.\n\nThis entry documents the reasoning process behind a longer conceptual essay, rather than presenting a finalized position.\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{k._sg.2025,\n  author = {K.
