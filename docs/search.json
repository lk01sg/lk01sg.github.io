    "text": "Hi, Iâ€™m Linda K. Sg.\n\nWith a background in pharmacy and a masterâ€™s degree in Pharmacology and Toxicology from ITB, my work has always revolved around bridging life sciences, data, and engineering to address real-world health challenges. Iâ€™ve contributed to improving medical data quality at an Indonesian health-tech startup, provided pharmacy services to my local community, and taught pharmacology and chemical engineeringâ€”mentoring aspiring scientific professionals along the way.\nMy current interests span systems biology, PK/PD modeling, computational drug design, network pharmacology, and protein structure predictionâ€”fields I see as pivotal for advancing drug discovery and the life sciences. The goal is to translate complex knowledge into solutions that are accessible, practical, and impactful.\nAlongside my scientific work, Iâ€™m also an Independent Creator & Digital Strategist. I design and manage digital ecosystems where ideas can move across platformsâ€”through writing, media, and digital productsâ€”connecting research, storytelling, and community building.\nCollaboration excites me, especially on projects at the intersection of health technology, educational platforms, and cutting-edge research. If youâ€™re working on something in these areas, Iâ€™d be glad to connect."

    "text": "ðŸ“š On Writing\nI run SyntesaMateria and UPPETI, two independent digital media platforms. SyntesaMateria focuses on science and technology, publishing curated content, in-depth articles, and educational resources for students, researchers, and a broader audience. UPPETI serves as a more personal and creative outlet, where I explore philosophy, art, and reflective writing. Together, they represent complementary sides of my writing and creative practice. More details about these platforms can be found here.\nDigital resources, guides, and creative projects are also available on my Gumroad page, offering content that extends and complements the work published on both platforms."
